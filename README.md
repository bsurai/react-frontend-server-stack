## Note

This is still in work-in-progress.

### To start
- install lerna as global

`npm install -g lerna` and/or `npm install`

- run lerna bootstrap, which installs all the sub packages

`lerna bootstrap`

- run build 

`lerna run build` (** this might fail, you can run it individually in each packages**)
